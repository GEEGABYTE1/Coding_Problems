Problem:

Given an array arr[] consisting of N positive integers, 
the task is to rotate the digits of array elements in an anti-clockwise direction such that elements of 
the array elements are in alternate even-odd or odd-even form. If multiple solutions exists, 
then print any one of them. Otherwise, print -1.


Example:


Input: arr[] = { 143, 251, 534, 232, 854 }
Output: 143 512 345 232 485
Explanation: 
Rotating arr[1] by 1 in anticlockwise direction modifies arr[1] to 512. 
Rotating arr[2] by 1 in anticlockwise direction modifies arr[2] to 345. 
Rotating arr[4] by 2 in anticlockwise direction modifies arr[4] to 485.

Input: arr[] = { 44, 23, 21, 33, 14 }
Output: 44 23 12 33 14
