# K number of smallest elements in a given array


Question: Write an efficient program for printing k largest elements in an array. Elements in array can be in any order.
For example, if given array is [1, 23, 12, 9, 30, 2, 50] and you are asked for the largest 3 elements i.e., k = 3 then your program should print 50, 30 and 2

The Heap solution is under `heap.py`
Time Complexity: O(N) 

# Radix Sort Solution 

The Radix sort algorithm was used to sort the list. 

Solution is under `radix_sort_solution.py`. 
Time Complexity: O(N)
