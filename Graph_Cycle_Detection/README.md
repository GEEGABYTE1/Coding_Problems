# Cycle Detection in Directed Graphs 

*Problem: Given a directed graph, check whether the graph contains a cycle or not. Your function should return the path if the given graph contains at least one cycle, else return False*


# Solution 

For my solution, I decided to make two functions.

The first function called, `.single_direct()`, is a helper function that returns a dictionary of vertices as keys and their edges as their values. The returned dictionary helps us find the "multiple values" later on to detect if there is a cycle or not. 

The second function is the algorithm itself called `.path_visualizer()`, which is a recursive path that takes a graph, and three other base values; path (empty list), counter (set to 0), and root_element (None). Note that all the keyword arguments are for reference for the algorithm.

There are four cases that makes this recursive algorithm work:

  1) If the graph only has one node, the algorithm will return the node itself
  2) If the graph is empty, the algorithm will return `None`
  3) If the current node has the goal node within it's edge, the algorithm will add the current node and will return the path at the end
  4) If the current node does not have the node within, the algorithm will add the node to the traversal path. The root element stays the same and the algorithm will recurse making the first edge the current node. To check if there is a cycle involving the root element, the algorithm will take all the edges and will see if the current node appears in the list of edges at least one. If it is, we keep the root element the same for reference when we recurse, otherwise, we will recurse with the root element being the next node in the original dictionary. Do remember that the root element is needed as we use it to reference if it is apart of a cycle or not.
  5) After iterating through each edge (if there are no edges or one), it will check if the path == 0, if so, it will pass (this is necessary because in some input cases, there are graphs given with one or no edges). Another condition the algorithm checks under this case is if it the last element is equivalent to the first. This condition is our successive case, and which, will return the path of the cycle. If none of this sub-cases meet, the algorithm will recurse like the previous case, making the root element the next node. We do this because if none of the cases above are met, that only means that the root element (which in this case, would be the root element) was never part of a cycle in the first place.

  Additionally, if any of these cases are not met, we can conclude that the cycle has not been found
