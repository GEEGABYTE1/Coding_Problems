# Problem

Given a dictionary, implement a graph. The keys of the dictionary used are the nodes of our graph and the corresponding values are lists with each nodes, which are connecting by an edge. 
This simple graph has six nodes (a-f) and five arcs: 

- `a -> c `
- `b -> c `
- `b -> e `
- `c -> a `
- `c -> b `
- `c -> d `
- `c -> e `
- `d -> c `
- `e -> c `
- `e -> b `

## Input  
`graph = { "a" : ["c"],
          "b" : ["c", "e"],
          "c" : ["a", "b", "d", "e"],
          "d" : ["c"],
          "e" : ["c", "b"],
          "f" : []
        } `
        
## Output 

`[('a', 'c'), ('c', 'd'), ('c', 'e'), ('c', 'a'), ('c', 'b'), 
('b', 'c'), ('b', 'e'), ('e', 'b'), ('e', 'c'), ('d', 'c')]`

# Extras:

`create_path()` creates and edge to a vertex that it did not have an edge with by default (part of the problem) 
`gen_path()` prints all possible paths and prints the shortest path between two vertices 


*Note*: This is not the solution to full problem, rather only the first two.
