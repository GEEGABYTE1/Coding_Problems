# Problem

Given a dictionary, implement a graph. The keys of the dictionary used are the nodes of our graph and the corresponding values are lists with each nodes, which are connecting by an edge. 
This simple graph has six nodes (a-f) and five arcs: 

- `a -> c `
- `b -> c `
- `b -> e `
- `c -> a `
- `c -> b `
- `c -> d `
- `c -> e `
- `d -> c `
- `e -> c `
- `e -> b `

## Input  
`graph = { "a" : ["c"],
          "b" : ["c", "e"],
          "c" : ["a", "b", "d", "e"],
          "d" : ["c"],
          "e" : ["c", "b"],
          "f" : []
        } `
        
## Output 

`[('a', 'c'), ('c', 'd'), ('c', 'e'), ('c', 'a'), ('c', 'b'), 
('b', 'c'), ('b', 'e'), ('e', 'b'), ('e', 'c'), ('d', 'c')]`
