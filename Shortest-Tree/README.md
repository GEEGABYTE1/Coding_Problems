# Shortest Tree

# Problem 

Given two trees, return the shortest tree. If both trees have the same length/depth, return 0. 

Each Tree will at least a root node. 


# Solution 

My solution has a time complexity of `O(N)` and space complexity of `O(1)`

*Complexities have been generalized*

In the file, I have created a `TreeNode` class to establish the trees for the inputs. At the bottom of the class, there are some test inputs to initalize the two trees, and below that there is the solution.
